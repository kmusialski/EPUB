A. Magnus</h2> <p class="nonindent no-indent">1.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">MIDDAY of Life! Oh, season of delight!<br/> My summer’s park!<br/> Uneaseful joy to look, to lurk, to hark—<br/> I peer for friends, am ready day and night,—<br/> Where linger ye, my friends? The time is right!</p> <p class="indent no-indent">2.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">Is not the glacier’s grey today for you<br/> Rose-garlanded?<br/> The brooklet seeks you, wind, cloud, with longing thread<br/> And thrust themselves yet higher to the blue,<br/> To spy for you from farthest eagle’s view.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">3.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">My table was spread out for you on high—<br/> Who dwelleth so<br/> Star-near, so near the grisly pit below?—<br/> My realm—what realm hath wider boundary?<br/> My honey—who hath sipped its fragrancy?</p> <p class="indent no-indent">4.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">Friends, ye are there! Woe me,—yet I am not<br/> He whom ye seek?<br/> Ye stare and stop—better your wrath could speak!<br/> I am not I? Hand, gait, face, changed? And what<br/> I am, to you my friends, now am I not?</p> <p class="indent no-indent">5.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">Am I an other? Strange am I to Me?<br/> Yet from Me sprung?<br/> A wrestler, by himself too oft self-wrung?<br/> Hindering too oft my own self’s potency,<br/> Wounded and hampered by self-victory?</p> <p class="indent no-indent">6.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">I sought where-so the wind blows keenest. There<br/> I learned to dwell<br/> Where no man dwells, on lonesome ice-lorn fell,<br/> And unlearned Man and God and curse and prayer?<br/> Became a ghost haunting the glaciers bare?</p> <p class="indent no-indent">7.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">Ye, my old friends! Look! Ye turn pale, filled o’er<br/> With love and fear!<br/> Go! Yet not in wrath. Ye could ne’er live here.<br/> Here in the farthest realm of ice and scaur,<br/> A huntsman must one be, like chamois soar.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">8.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">An evil huntsman was I? See how taut<br/> My bow was bent!<br/> Strongest was he by whom such bolt were sent—<br/> Woe now! That arrow is with peril fraught,<br/> Perilous as none.—Have yon safe home ye sought!</p> <p class="indent no-indent">9.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">Ye go! Thou didst endure enough, oh, heart;—<br/> Strong was thy hope;<br/> Unto new friends thy portals widely ope,<br/> Let old ones be. Bid memory depart!<br/> Wast thou young then, now—better young thou art!</p> <p class="indent no-indent">10.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">What linked us once together, one hope’s tie—<br/> (Who now doth con<br/> Those lines, now fading, Love once wrote thereon?)—<br/> Is like a parchment, which the hand is shy<br/> To touch—like crackling leaves, all seared, all dry.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">11.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">Oh! Friends no more! They are—what name for those?—<br/> Friends’ phantom-flight<br/> Knocking at my heart’s window-pane at night,<br/> Gazing on me, that speaks “We were” and goes,—<br/> Oh, withered words, once fragrant as the rose!</p> <p class="indent no-indent">12.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">Pinings of youth that might not understand!<br/> For which I pined,<br/> Which I deemed changed with me, kin of my kind:<br/> But they grew old, and thus were doomed and banned:<br/> None but new kith are native of my land!</p> <p class="indent no-indent">13.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">Midday of life! My second youth’s delight!<br/> My summer’s park!<br/> Unrestful joy to long, to lurk, to hark!<br/> I peer for friends!—am ready day and night,<br/> For my new friends. Come! Come! The time is right!</p> <p class="indent no-indent">14.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">This song is done,—the sweet sad cry of rue<br/> Sang out its end;<br/> A wizard wrought it, he the timely friend,<br/> The midday-friend,—no, do not ask me who;<br/> At midday ’twas, when one became as two.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">15.</p> <p class="indent no-indent">We keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our bourne,<br/> Our aims self-same:<br/> The Guest of Guests, friend Zarathustra, came!<br/> The world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn,<br/> And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn.</p>
